# QT6_Basic



# QT6 Basic Practice

This project contains my daily Qt6 learning exercises.  
Each day has its own folder with source code and a CMake build file.

## Project Structure

| Day | Folder Name | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | `Day_0001`  | HelloWorld |
| 2   | `Day_0002`  | *(add later)* |
| 3   | `Day_0003`  | *(add later)* |

Update this table each day when new code is added.

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./HelloWorld
